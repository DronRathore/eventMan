Benchmarks
==========
To be clear and straight forward, we are fast! And by fast I mean, very fast!

###eventMan Vs jQuery 1.7
The difference in the performace is almost 200(+)%.
- eventMan

- jQuery
	- *Calls* : 1000, *Time elapsed* : 112ms average


###eventMan Vs jQuery 2.1
I should acknowledge the hard work jQuery team put up in their latest release, but still beating eventMan wasn't possible.
The difference was still at the edge of ~150%

- jQuery
	- *Calls* : 1000, *Time elapsed* : 86ms average
